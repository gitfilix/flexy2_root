								Goldsworthy an extraordinary, innovative British artist whose collaborations with nature produce uniquely personal and intense artworks. 
									Using a seemingly endless range of natural materials —snow, ice, leaves, bark, rock, clay, stones, feathers petals, twigs—
									he creates outdoor sculpture that manifests, however fleeting, a sympathetic contact with the natural world.

					Goldsworthy regards his creations as transient, or ephemeral. He photographs each piece once right after he makes it. His goal is to understand nature by directly		 				participating in nature as intimately as he can.

					<br>
							Artist Andy Goldsworthy talks about and demonstrates creating artwork in a natural landscape using natural materials. Working on site in a quarry, Goldsworthy			  					makes an abstract drawing on slate and shows how a 'dry shadow' can be made on stone during wet weather. He explores the temporary nature of some landscape  	 					artwork and the effects which can be produced there.

								The materials used in Andy Goldsworthy's art often include brightly coloured flowers, icicles, leaves, mud, pinecones, snow, stone, twigs, and thorns. He has been quoted as saying, "I think it's incredibly brave to be working with flowers and leaves and petals. But I have to: I can't edit the materials I work with.

To create "Roof", Goldsworthy worked with his assistant and five British dry-stone wallers, who were used to make sure the structure could withstand time and nature.

								The materials used in Andy Goldsworthy's art often include brightly coloured flowers, icicles, leaves, mud, pinecones, snow, stone, twigs, and thorns.

To create "Roof", Goldsworthy worked with his assistant and five British dry-stone wallers, who were used to make sure the structure could withstand time and nature.
